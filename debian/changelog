python-networkx (0.99-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable now that lenny is released (yay).
  * Fix FTBFS with python-support 0.90.3: no longer rely on its internal
    behaviour, and xnow set tests/test.py executable right after “setup.py
    install” (Closes: #517065).
  * Drop executable bits from bz2 files.
  * Update Vcs-* fields: move from DPMT's svn to collab-maint's git.
  * Remote DPMT from Uploaders, following Piotr Ożarowski's request.

  * debian/control:
     + Replace python-setuptools with python-pkg-resources in the

python-networkx (0.35.1.dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Piotr Ożarowski ]
  * Add Homepage field, delete it from the long description.
  * Rename XS-Vcs-* fields to Vcs-*.

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Add version mangling to debian/watch, stripping the “.dfsg” part of
    the Debian version.
  * debian/rules cleanup: Delete trailing whitespaces, delete unused
    DEB_UPSTREAM_VERSION (which became wrong anyway, due to the “.dfsg”
    part of the version).
  * Bump Standards-Version from 3.7.2 to 3.7.3, no change needed.
  * Move the build instructions from “binary-arch” to “binary-indep”,
    per lintian.
  * Move the section from “graphics” to “python”, per lintian.
  * Create a pristine copy of the networkx.egg-info/SOURCES.txt file during
    the “install” target, which gets restored during the “clean” one.

python-networkx (0.35.1.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

    modifications are allowed.
  * debian/rules:
     + Removed two new unneeded files: Download.txt and Install.txt.
     + Removed the find/rm for the .cvsignore files, now deleted upstream.

python-networkx (0.34-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a versioned B-D on python-suppport (>= 0.6.4) since #422436 is
    fixed in this version, and on python-all-dev (>= 2.3.5-11), according
    to the Python Policy.
  * Dropped the manual egg renaming, which isn't needed anymore, and even
    fails with the new python-support (Closes: #423981).
  * Turned setup.py usage into setup_egg.py usage. 20_egg_support patch
    dropped accordingly.
  * Added a TODO file so as not to forget TODO items for next uploads.
  * Added a find/rm to remove some .cvsignore files, now installed after
    the switch to setup_egg.py.
  * Adjusted README.Debian and Recommends:, since python-yaml is now packaged,
    and added instructions to run the testsuite from a python interpreter.

python-networkx (0.34-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Many thanks to Piotr Ożarowski for his careful review and his numerous
    suggestions for this upload.
  * Examples might not work out of the box due to the compression of the data
    files, but adding support for compressed data files has been requested
    upstream (#104), so that the data files don't have to be shipped
    uncompressed. Should be working in the next version.
  * Added the Debian Python Modules Team in the Uploaders field.
  * Updated rules file to delete an empty directory (data/, under the doc/
    directory).
  * Adjusted the folding in the long description for the homepage.
  * Added missing B-D on setuptools, needed for the egg installation. It is
    versioned so that one is ensured that egg support is present (e.g. when
    backporting).
  * Added missing Recommends on python-matplotlib.
  * Removed unneeded items in the rules file (e.g. CFLAGS, dh_strip, etc.) as
    well as ${python:Provides} and ${shlibs:Depends} in the control file.
  * Removed the lintian override and added a chmod call to +x the test script
    after the dh_pysupport call.
  * Dropped unneeded build-stamp, configure, configure-stamp targets in the
    rules file.
  * Added *.pyc cleanup in the clean target. During a normal build it
    shouldn't be needed, but might be useful when playing around with the
    package.

python-networkx (0.33-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * New features:
     - draw edges with specified colormap
     - more efficient version of Floyd's algorithm for all pairs shortest path
     - include tests in source package (networkx/tests)
     - include documentation in source package (doc)
  * Bug fixes:
     - refactored large modules into smaller code files
     - degree(nbunch) now returns degrees in same order as nbunch
     - degree() now works for multiedges=True
     - update node_boundary and edge_boundary for efficiency
     - edited documentation for graph classes, now mostly in info.py
  * Removed python-numeric from Recommends: (obsolete, no longer supported).
  * Added python-setuptools to Recommends: so that one can easily use the
    following to run the testsuite.
      import networkx
      networkx.test()
  * Changed watch file from sourceforge to upstream's homepage download
    section.
  * Changed the install rule so that there's no .pyc compilation at all, since
    they are created during the postinst (and thus were deleted after the
    ``setup.py install'' call).
  * Switched from dpatch to quilt to ease patch management.


  Thanks to Oleksandr Moskalenko and Piotr Ożarowski for the time they spent
  on advising me about the following items.
  * Added a B-D on python-all-dev.
  * Added egg support:
     - added 20_egg_support to import setup from setuptools in setup.py;
     - added the --single-version-externally-managed option to the
       "setup.py install" call;
     - tweaked debian/rules to strip out the version info from the egg
       info dir.
  * Cleaned *.txt documentation files: license-related files are no longer
    installed, superseded by debian/copyright, and Readme.txt is installed as
    README.

python-networkx (0.32-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a Recommends: on python-pygraphviz | python-pydot, thanks to Seo
    Sanghyeon for the notice about pydot (Closes: #401657).
  * Fixed a typo in the debian/watch file.

python-networkx (0.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #323398)
  * Added an override for the tests/test.py file which is not executable due
    to python-support (apparently). Interested users should be able to run
    this script by prepending its name with the interpreter.
  * Added ``2.4-'' into debian/pyversions since the installation fails when
    byte-compiling for python2.3. Upstream will be reported that problem since
    that release is said to be for python >= 2.3.
  * Added Recommends: on all packages needed for the tests/test.py to run
    almost OK. There's currently no package providing `yaml' so that having
    ``import yaml'' in a python script is OK.
  * Added a note about the previous point in the README.Debian file.
  * Added Suggests: on all optional packages suggested by upstream.
